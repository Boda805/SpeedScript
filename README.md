SpeedScript is a small application meant to easily ingest transcript records from outside the current district (most commonly online courses) and into the Infinite Campus SIS. This is done in three steps:

1. Open the upload template.

2. Populate the template with records. Take precaution on fields such as StateID, making the column is data type 'Text'.

3. Upload the populated template file. This will give a status indicator if the information was correctly entered or if there are errors.

4. If there are no errors. All that is left is to hit submit. After doing so you should immediately see the records from the spreadsheet on student's transcripts.
